# Assets Folder

This folder should contain the following image files for the Expo app:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

For now, you can use placeholder images or generate them using:
- Expo's asset generator: `npx expo-asset-generator`
- Or create simple colored squares as placeholders

The app will work without these, but you'll see warnings. You can add actual images later.
